// ==== Closures ==== 

/* Task 1: Study the code below and explain in your own words why nested function can access the variable internal. */


const external = "I'm outside the function";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(external);
  const internal = "Hello! I'm inside myFunction!";

  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  };
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();

// Explanation: 

//This is a typical example of closure in that the nested function body has access to the outside scope and searches for 'internal' outside of itself as it is not yet defined within it's own scope.


/* Task 2: Counter */

/* Create a function called `summation` that accepts a parameter and uses a counter to return the summation of that number. For example, `summation(4)` should return 10 because 1+2+3+4 is 10. */

function summation(x){
 return x * (x + 1) / 2;
}
console.log(summation(4));
